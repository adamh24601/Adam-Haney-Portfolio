## About Me

Hello, I am a recent graduate from the MS Data Analytics program at UCF; an experienced researcher, and recipienrt of UCF's Top Data Scholar award. Thank you for taking the time to visit my Portfolio and sample some of my various projects. As a researcher, I have published several studies focusing on the Hospitality and Tourism industry; investigating issues such as the effects of COVID0-19, Consumer Behavioral Trends, and DMO usage of AI products. Throughout these studies and in my own personal analysis projects; I have applied Qualitative and Quantitative methodologies and used tools such as Python, SQL, and R for data exploration, analysis, preparation, and modeling. I also have used Excel and Tableau both in my job as a researcher and in my Data Analyst position wherein I have communicated with various teams under the Student Affairs umbrella to develop new dashbaords to track key metrics that these teams care about. My most notable achievement being developing a Fails dashboard to help the registrar team catch any missed reschedules of failed classes; and to help the Education team keep track of classes and programs that have an unusual proportion of fail grades in a given term.
