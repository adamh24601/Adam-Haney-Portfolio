## About Me

Hello, I am a recent graduate from the MS Data Analytics program at UCF; an experienced researcher, and recipient of UCF's Top Data Scholar award for top academic performance and contributions to the overall field of Data Analytics. Thank you for taking the time to visit my Portfolio and sample some of my various projects. As a researcher, I have published several studies focusing on the Hospitality and Tourism industry; investigating issues such as the effects of COVID0-19, Consumer Behavioral Trends, and DMO usage of AI products. Throughout these studies and in my own personal machine learning and analytics projects; I have applied Qualitative and Quantitative methodologies and used tools such as Python, SQL, and R for data exploration, analysis, preparation, and modeling. I also have used Excel and Tableau both in my job as a researcher and in my Data Analyst position wherein I have communicated with various teams under the Student Affairs umbrella to develop new dashbaords to track key metrics that these teams care about. My most notable achievement being developing a Fails dashboard to help the registrar team catch any missed reschedules of failed classes; and to help the Education team keep track of classes and programs that have an unusual proportion of fail grades in a given term. My corusework in Psychology and Enterrtainment Management as well has aided in my professional development as an analyst and researcher by providing additional business-related and sociological context when developing analytics tools and presenting analytics projects; particularly with regard to survey design, candidate selection, survey presentation, and presentation and communication with stakeholders.
